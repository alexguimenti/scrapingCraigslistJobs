Initially, you will report directly to either the President for Science or the Director of Sales.  We are looking for people who can meaningfully contribute to serving the farming community, either in composting or in sales.

Job Description and Compensation: 

• Manage and organize delivery, using existing relationships 
• Contribute to marketing with photos and comments for Instagram, email marketing and other outreach tools
• Track and report progress and growth to your supervisor.


Key Qualifications:

• Previous experience in composting (Soil Food Web or Korean Natural Farming ) or sales (agricultural sales experience)  and connections to farming is strongly preferred
• Basic knowledge of organic farming and compost is essential
• SymSoil is a science-based company: a bachelor's degree in agricultural science, business or certification in Permaculture Design, Soil Food Web or KNF is important
• Experience with Customer Relationship Management software, such as Zoho, is helpful 
• Geographical knowledge of California agriculture and/or nurseries and indoor agriculture
• Ability to work autonomously
• Team player, ability to work with the SymSoil team

Requirements:
Must be at least 21 years old
Must have a California ID
Must have a working vehicle

About SymSoil 
SymSoil Inc. is an emerging startup serving the agricultural industry with a focus on soil health and its economic and environmental benefits. 

SymSoil(tm) Robust Compost is a biologically-active, solid soil amendment that is manufactured using a different process than those currently employed by commercial compost facilities. While it looks like compost, in reality it is a solid transport material for cultivated, regionally-specific, indigenous soil microbes that result in superior plant growth. 

The team at SymSoil has 35 years of experience improving soil, closing the biological and ecological gaps left by conventional agriculture. Inspired by Dr Elaine Ingham, the SymSoil team has members trained in Korean Natural Farming (KNF), Soil Food Web, Permaculture, other composting traditions and other aspects of organic farming, including expertise and making and using biochar.

Validation Engineer/Specialist


Job Label: MAG_1675D1886A1


We need C&Q Geniuses!

Do you love figuring out how something works, making sure it's performing properly, and helping life saving drugs get to patients?  We want you to grow with us at Total Validation Services to perform Commissioning, Qualification and Validation protocol generation, execution and report writing.  We have openings for Validation Engineers in Biotech Facilities, Utilities, Equipment, Laboratory Instruments, Cleaning Validation and Shipping Validation.  We serve large and small clients throughout the Bay Area and are expanding throughout the West Coast.  TVS is proud that we work with our clients to create teams to deliver solutions for projects of all sizes and we need more smart, hard working people to join us. Candidates must have a Engineering or Science Bachelors Degree at a minimum or significant specific validation experience.

Almost all of our team members work with other TVS people to form a team at a site.  With the odd exception, you'll have someone at your side at all times to help each other deliver.



TVS, Inc. was originally formed twenty-five years ago to provide independent contract validation services to the biotechnology industry. Today, we have grown to provide a broad range of commissioning, qualification, validation, quality, compliance, and project management services. Our work experience spans all facets of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries.



People who are successful with TVS, work well in a team environment and know how to influence the project in the right direction without having authority.  (We're contractors after all....) 

You'll do well when you have a great eye for detail, can pull information from multiple sources, follow SOPs and figure out how to write a great test document, execute that testing cleanly, troubleshoot deviations and write a great summary.

You'll be responsible for preparing, executing and/or reviewing validation deliverables as assigned by the Project Manager or Lead. These include: start-up procedures, commissioning documents, validation protocols and reports (IQ, OQ, CSQ, PQ, process validation, cleaning validation, etc.), development reports, acceptance testing protocols. You also may also assist in the production of user requirements, specifications, standard operating procedures and other documentation required for the completion of the validation

You'll be responsible for providing technical support and technical expertise to project team to facilitate resolution of system and quality issues, either from direct experience or from available source materials

This is important!  You'll interact directly with clients on an as needed basis regarding system/process specific activities and basic project related activities. You'll act as liaison between the client and Project Leader/ Project Manager as needed.  This means you'll have to be diplomatic, courteous and do what you commit to doing.

Comments from one of our long time therapists:

""I have been a massage therapist for 13 years, operating my own private practice for eight years, in addition to various therapeutic environments. After moving to the Bay Area six years ago, I contracted with Mill Valley Massage and found that it was the perfect place for me. The front desk staff is warm and supportive, the therapists are top notch, my schedule is consistently booked and the client work is fulfilling.  Mill Valley Massage handles the business details so I can focus on giving the utmost care to the clients, a welcome change after the stress of running my own practice.  I really enjoy being able to give my best as a massage therapist and Mill Valley Massage is a great environment to do just that."" 

-Sylvia G.

Owner's Perspective:

""I wanted a place that was comfortable for therapists as well as clients. A place where one could come in and focus on the reason they became a massage therapist, to help people and work in relaxed comfortable environment. 

You probably don't want 50 minute sessions every hour on the hour, long 8 hour shifts, a menu that requires you to learn and do a signature massage protocol, cleaning around the studio, no breaks, or a corporate franchise business structure that breeds drama and competition...

We're here for you.""

Are you tired of sales jobs that suck?
Or would the ""you"" from two years ago be shocked you're still struggling to ""make it"" financially in sales?
Well forget about those commission only job ""opportunities"" ...
... how would you like to be able to get multiple job offers (on-demand) from GREAT companies with a high base salary PLUS commissions?
If the answer is ""yes"" to these questions... you need to get into software sales.
Many software companies can't find qualified people to hire for their entry level sales roles.
As a result, there are over 50,000 open software sales positions right now!
Yet, somehow, instead of making themselves good candidates for software sales, many people still apply for sales jobs in other industries...
...even though those jobs pay less than HALF what software sales pays!
The average car salesperson only makes $31,500 a year, according to Glassdoor.
The average software sales rep brings in $100,800 per year!!!
Working in software sales isn't just about the money. It's also about having a high-quality lifestyle.
The best sales pros work at software companies that pay a high salary PLUS commission, benefits and other great perks (like a keg in the office, paid/unlimited vacation, etc).
Oh, and extra bonus...the product they sell has a strong demand.
That means it's EASY to sell.
The only thing is, you need to have the right experience and background to get these jobs.
This leads to exactly why many brand-new AND experienced salespeople are signing up for the preHIRED program -- the ONLY sales bootcamp with a 96% placement rate into a Six-Figure Sales Career.
You read that right. 96% of preHIRED graduates receive an offer for a 6-figure career at a software company.
If you are tired of not making enough money in sales, or tired of working at company you don't like -- then this may be just for you... so check this out.
preHIRED is an Online Science-Based Sales® Bootcamp & Job Placement Program Where We Help Regular Sales Folks Get Six-Figure Software Sales Careers In Just 6-Weeks!
We train you on the SOFTWARE industry, and how to get your foot in the door.
